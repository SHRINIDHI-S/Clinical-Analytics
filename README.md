# Building a Large Language Model (LLM) for Clinical Analytics

## 📌 Introduction
In the medical field, clinical text analytics plays a crucial role in automating documentation, summarizing patient reports, and assisting medical decision-making. Traditional models often struggle with domain-specific terminology, but Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for generating, summarizing, and analyzing clinical texts efficiently.

This project builds and fine-tunes a Transformer-based LLM from scratch specifically on medical datasets to support clinical applications.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- ✅ Summarize clinical reports for quick insights.
- ✅ Generate accurate medical documentation.
- ✅ Answer medical questions based on clinical texts.

## 🛠️ Project Approach
The project is structured in key stages:

### 1️⃣ Data Acquisition
- **Dataset Used:** PubMedQA (openly available via Hugging Face)
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning text, removing noise, special characters, and ensuring data consistency.

### 2️⃣ Tokenization & Preprocessing
- **Tokenizer:** GPT-2's Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- **Preparation:** Uniform padding and truncation to ensure efficient model training.

### 3️⃣ Model Architecture
- **Base Model:** GPT-2 Transformer architecture
- **Fine-Tuning:** Adapting GPT-2 specifically to medical text.

### 4️⃣ Model Training
- **Training Procedure:** Mini-batch optimization, Cross-Entropy Loss, Adam optimizer
- **Hyperparameters:** Adjusted learning rate, batch size, epochs, and gradient checkpointing for optimal performance

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used:**
  - **Perplexity (PPL)** for fluency assessment
  - **BLEU Score** for text similarity with real clinical reports
  - **ROUGE Score** for summarization accuracy

### 6️⃣ Deployment & Testing
- **API Deployment:** Expose model through FastAPI or Hugging Face Spaces
- **Real-world Testing:** Use input prompts to generate medical documentation and summaries

## 🚀 Key Results
- ✅ Successfully fine-tuned GPT-2 to understand clinical contexts.
- ✅ Capable of generating relevant, fluent, and medically accurate text.
- ✅ Ready for integration into real-world clinical workflows for documentation and analytics.

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- **Extended Training:** Increase epochs and dataset diversity.
- **Data Augmentation:** Apply techniques to enrich the dataset.
- **Advanced Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization to boost performance.

## 🌍 Deployment Options
- Conversion to ONNX or TorchScript for broader compatibility
- Deployment to AWS, Google Cloud, or Hugging Face Spaces
